THE FOLLOWING SITE WAS WRITTEN AS A FRONT END QUIZ. I'M USING SVG IMAGES AS OPPOSED TO TYPICAL .PNG OR .JPG.

INCLUDED ARE SEPERATE SHEETS FOR HTML, CSS, and JS. 

THIS TYPE OF ANIMATION WORK COULD ALSO BE ACCOMPLISHED USING JUST CSS3. FOR THIS PROJECT I WANTED TO SHOW SOME VERSITITLITY IN WORKING WITH A JS LIBRARY, IN THIS CASE GREENSOCK.
